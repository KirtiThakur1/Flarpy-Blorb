## Flappy Bird (Unity 2D)

**Flappy Bird** is a **2D mini-game** created in **Unity**.  
I aimed to design a simple yet fully functional game, and throughout the process, I learned many fundamental concepts that form the backbone of Unity game development.

###  What I Built:
- 🐤 A **character** that moves smoothly in response to player input  
- ⏱️ **Object spawning** based on timed intervals  
- 🧮 A **UI system** that displays the score and updates dynamically when conditions are met  
- 💀 A **Game Over** screen with the ability to restart and play again  

### 🎓 What I Learned
This project helped me understand essential Unity principles such as **scene management**, **UI handling**, **game logic scripting**, and **event-driven updates**. These lessons will be invaluable for developing more advanced and diverse games in the future.
